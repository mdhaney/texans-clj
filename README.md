# texans-clj

One of the first things I wrote when I started playing around with clojure.

I was just playing around with Enlive, and started writing this to scrape
salary data from overthecap.com.  I didn't get very far, but what's there works,
and I'm pretty proud of it considering I had only started learning Clojure a few
weeks earlier.  I'll swing back and do more with it someday - only next time I'll feed the data into Datomic.

Ultimately, I would like to use this data
to feed a little visualization webapp to play with salary cap scenarios (also as of yet unwritten).
